        Returns up to a year of past events for a given user

        By default this returns events for the authenticated user. To retrieve events


        for the entire enterprise, set the `stream_type` to `admin_logs_streaming`


        for live monitoring of new events, or `admin_logs` for querying across


        historical events. The user making the API call will


        need to have admin privileges, and the application will need to have the


        scope `manage enterprise properties` checked.

        :param stream_type: Defines the type of events that are returned
            * `all` returns everything for a user and is the default
            * `changes` returns events that may cause file tree changes
              such as file updates or collaborations.
            * `sync` is similar to `changes` but only applies to synced folders
            * `admin_logs` returns all events for an entire enterprise and
              requires the user making the API call to have admin permissions. This
              stream type is for programmatically pulling from a 1 year history of
              events across all users within the enterprise and within a
              `created_after` and `created_before` time frame. The complete history
              of events will be returned in chronological order based on the event
              time, but latency will be much higher than `admin_logs_streaming`.
            * `admin_logs_streaming` returns all events for an entire enterprise and
              requires the user making the API call to have admin permissions. This
              stream type is for polling for recent events across all users within
              the enterprise. Latency will be much lower than `admin_logs`, but

        Returns a list of real-time servers that can be used for long-polling updates

        to the [event stream](#get-events).


        Long polling is the concept where a HTTP request is kept open until the


        server sends a response, then repeating the process over and over to receive


        updated responses.


        Long polling the event stream can only be used for user events, not for


        enterprise events.


        To use long polling, first use this endpoint to retrieve a list of long poll


        URLs. Next, make a long poll request to any of the provided URLs.


        When an event occurs in monitored account a response with the value


        `new_change` will be sent. The response contains no other details as


        it only serves as a prompt to take further action such as sending a


        request to the [events endpoint](#get-events) with the last known


        `stream_position`.


        After the server sends this response it closes the connection. You must now


        repeat the long poll process to begin listening for events again.


        If no events occur for a while and the connection times out you will


        receive a response with the value `reconnect`. When you receive this response


        youâ€™ll make another call to this endpoint to restart the process.


        If you receive no events in `retry_timeout` seconds then you will need to


        make another request to the real-time server (one of the URLs in the response


        for this endpoint). This might be necessary due to network errors.


        Finally, if you receive a `max_retries` error when making a request to the


        real-time server, you should start over by making a call to this endpoint


        first.
