        Move all of the items (files, folders and workflows) owned by a user into

        another user's account


        Only the root folder (`0`) can be transferred.


        Folders can only be moved across users by users with administrative


        permissions.


        All existing shared links and folder-level collaborations are transferred


        during the operation. Please note that while collaborations at the individual


        file-level are transferred during the operation, the collaborations are


        deleted when the original user is deleted.


        This call will be performed synchronously which might lead to a slow response


        when the source user has a large number of items in all of its folders.


        If the destination path has a metadata cascade policy attached to any of


        the parent folders, a metadata cascade operation will be kicked off


        asynchronously.


        There is currently no way to check for when this operation is finished.


        The destination folder's name will be in the format `{User}'s Files and


        Folders`, where `{User}` is the display name of the user.


        To make this API call your application will need to have the "Read and write


        all files and folders stored in Box" scope enabled.


        Please make sure the destination user has access to `Relay` or `Relay Lite`,


        and has access to the files and folders involved in the workflows being


        transferred.


        Admins will receive an email when the operation is completed.

            Be aware that specifying this parameter will have the
