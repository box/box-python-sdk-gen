## Max retry attempts

The default maximum number of retries in case of failed API call is 5 (429 and >= 500 response codes are retried).
To change this number you can set `client.network.MAX_ATTEMPTS` field.

```python
from box_sdk.client import Client
from box_sdk.developer_token_auth import DeveloperTokenAuth

auth = DeveloperTokenAuth(token='DEVELOPER_TOKEN_GOES_HERE')
client = Client(auth=auth)
client.network.MAX_ATTEMPTS = 6
```
