        Folders`, where `{User}` is the display name of the user.

        
        To make this API call your application will need to have the "Read and write

        
        all files and folders stored in Box" scope enabled.

        
        Please make sure the destination user has access to `Relay` or `Relay Lite`,

        
        and has access to the files and folders involved in the workflows being

        
        transferred.
