              of events will be returned in chronological order based on the event
              time, but latency will be much higher than `admin_logs_streaming`.

        Returns a list of real-time servers that can be used for long-polling updates
        
        to the [event stream](#get-events).

        
        Long polling is the concept where a HTTP request is kept open until the

        
        server sends a response, then repeating the process over and over to receive

        
        updated responses.

        
        Long polling the event stream can only be used for user events, not for

        
        enterprise events.

        
        To use long polling, first use this endpoint to retrieve a list of long poll

        
        URLs. Next, make a long poll request to any of the provided URLs.

        
        When an event occurs in monitored account a response with the value

        
        `new_change` will be sent. The response contains no other details as

        
        it only serves as a prompt to take further action such as sending a

        
        request to the [events endpoint](#get-events) with the last known

        
        `stream_position`.

        
        After the server sends this response it closes the connection. You must now

        
        repeat the long poll process to begin listening for events again.

        
        If no events occur for a while and the connection times out you will

        
        receive a response with the value `reconnect`. When you receive this response

        
        youâ€™ll make another call to this endpoint to restart the process.

        
        If you receive no events in `retry_timeout` seconds then you will need to

        
        make another request to the real-time server (one of the URLs in the response

        
        for this endpoint). This might be necessary due to network errors.

        
        Finally, if you receive a `max_retries` error when making a request to the

        
        real-time server, you should start over by making a call to this endpoint

        
        first.
